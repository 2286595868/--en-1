                <h3>SI Simulation Analysis</h3>
                <p>We have a complete SI design and solution process for SI problems. Based on design and signal integrity timing requirements, pre-cabling simulation allows designers to select components, adjust part layouts, plan system clock networks, and determine termination strategies and topologies for critical networks. and determine the termination strategy and topology of critical networks. Post-routing simulation can evaluate whether routing parameters such as reflection, ringing, overshoot, crosstalk, and timing meet design requirements, helping to reveal potential SI issues and improve design reliability.</p>

                <h3>PI Simulation Analysis</h3>
                <p>If the design of the power grid is flawed, it will directly affect the stability of the entire system. We have accumulated a lot of experience in the field of high-current grid design. Combined with existing simulation methods in early design, we can detect early risks and optimize the layout of devices and power modules, no. The pads and capacitance distribution ensure the reliability of the power supply network design.</p>
                <h3>DFM</h3>
                <p>The boards, components and their construction will make the best choice in terms of cost, efficiency and quality, as the production-related process issues are taken into account when the product is used holistically from the beginning of product planning. In particular, the layout of the board needs to conform to this selection. In the design process, various simulation software and special inspection regulations are used for the inspection and modification of the board surface in each link to ensure the yield of the product from design to production, which greatly improves the manufacturability of the product design, so as to achieve the effect of saving time, materials and costs.</p>

                <h3>FAI System</h3>
                <p>The self-developed FAI (First Article Inspection) image inspection system can improve the accuracy of the first article, so as to ensure the first-time pass rate of the processed product.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Verify the correctness of the SMT program and component location. Avoid misalignment of components and incorrect installation, etc.</li>
                        <li>Consistency checks of component capacity and specifications with BOM to ensure correct installation.</li>
                        <li>Verification of the consistency of installation orientation, parameters and designer's intent</li>
                    </ul>
                </blockquote>
                <p>During production, if the first article inspection takes too long, the installed solder will be exposed for a long time, resulting in a decrease in optimality, in addition to a decrease in FAI on the circuit board on the furnace. The use of the FAI first inspection system can greatly reduce the time of the first inspection and absolutely avoid the above problems, in this case, the first inspection rate will reach more than 95%.</p>

Identify the materials in the process to ensure the identification of the materials and the traceability of the verification status.</p>

                <h3> Equipment control and maintenance</h3>
                <p>We establish regulations based on equipment, measuring instruments, etc., which affect quality characteristics, verify their accuracy before use, and periodically verify and recalibrate. In addition, they should be properly stored and protected between uses.

                <h3>Process change control</h3>
                <p>Ensure the correctness of process changes and their implementation, specify changes in responsibilities and authority, evaluate products after changes, and verify the expected impact of changes.</p>
                <h3>Verified controls</h3>
                <p>Identify the verification status of the process in an appropriate manner, distinguish between unverified, qualified or non-conforming products, and verify the responsibility for identity through identification.</p>

                <p>Develop and implement sub-quality product control procedures to detect, clearly identify, and isolate storage.

                <h3>Process Analysis:：</h3>
                <h4>PCB Process:</h4>
                <p>8 layers, thickness 1.0mm, OSP process.
                    The PCB of OSP process should not be exposed to direct sunlight, and the storage environment requirements: relative humidity: 30~70%, temperature: 15~30°C.
                    When unpacking at SMT site, the humidity indicator card must be checked and brought online within 12 hours, and kept to pass the furnace within 30 minutes. If the furnace time is too long, the solder paste will corrode and break the surface layer of the OSP and affect the soldering. During the production process, it is necessary to avoid touching the surface of the PCB directly with your hands, so as to avoid oxidation caused by sweat contamination on the surface. After the SMT single-sided patch is completed, the second-sided SMT part patch assembly must be completed within 24 hours. After completing the SMT, the DIP hand plug-in should be completed in the shortest possible time (up to 36 hours). OSP PCB should not be baked, and high-temperature baking will easily cause OSP discoloration and deterioration. If the empty board exceeds the service life, it can be returned to the PCB factory for OSP rework.</p>
                <h4>CPU Process：1515-ball micro-FCBGA。</h4>

                <p>    1515-ball micro-FCBGAThe welding of process packaging pays great attention to the design of the process, and the window opening method of each solder joint is different, and the furnace temperature, placement pressure, and so on must be set. If the process is not suitable, it will lead to poor BGA welding.</p>

                <h4>1.Chip baking</h4>
                <p>120±5 °C，24hours。(According to the moisture-proof situation of incoming materials and the characteristics of materials)</p>
                <h4>2.Stencil thickness：</h4>
                <p>0.08mm</p>
                <h4>3.Local optimization of stencil openings：</h4>
                <p>The window design is processed in different areas (the size and shape of each area and each solder joint may be different), and the shape and size of the tin under the design are analyzed according to the actual situation of the PCB and BGA.</p>

                <p>Use Alpha OM-340 5# powder.</p>
